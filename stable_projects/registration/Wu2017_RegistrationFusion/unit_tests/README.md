This README includes the instruction on how to run the unit tests for Wu2017_RegistrationFusion. Notice that all filenames and directories in this unit test **work for CBIG lab only**

## Data

The unit test script uses the Brain Genomics Superstruct Project (GSP) data. The preprocessed (by `recon-all`) structural MRI data are in the folder:
```
/mnt/eql/yeo1/data/GSP_release
```
where each subject folder is named by subject id + `_FS` (e.g. `Sub0001_Ses1_FS`)

In total, 5 subjects were used in the unit test, corresponding to the first 5 subjects using the default subject id list in `CBIG_RF` scripts (`$CBIG_CODE_DIR/stable_projects/registration/Wu2017_RegistrationFusion/bin/GSP_subjectid.csv`).

In addition, exiting ANTs registration warps between those 5 subjects and MNI152 space are taken from `/mnt/eql/yeo1/CBIG_private_unit_tests_data/stable_projects/registration/Wu2017_RegistrationFusion/warps`.

## Code

There are two main scripts for the unit test, `CBIG_RF_unit_test_vol2surf.sh` and `CBIG_RF_unit_test_surf2vol.sh`, with usage shown below. The script `CBIG_RF_unit_test_compare.m` is used by these two scripts to compare results, and should not be called by the user.

- MNI152-to-fsaverage test

To run the unit test, call `CBIG_RF_unit_test_vol2surf.sh`, using the `-o` option to specify where the results should be put.

The final projection results (in left hemisphere) will be compared to the default results in `/mnt/eql/yeo1/CBIG_private_unit_tests_data/stable_projects/registration/Wu2017_RegistrationFusion/data/` folder. The unit test is successful if the screen prints `The two volumes are identical`.

You can also check the right hemisphere results by comparing your projected result with `/mnt/eql/yeo1/CBIG_private_unit_tests_data/stable_projects/registration/Wu2017_RegistrationFusion/data/rh.projected_central_sulc.nii.gz`

This should take about 10min to run.

- fsaverage-to-MNI152 test

Note that this test should be run in FreeSurfer5.3 environment.

To run the unit test, call `CBIG_RF_unit_test_surf2vol.sh`, using the `-o` option to specify where the results should be put.

The final projection results will be compared to the default results in `/mnt/eql/yeo1/CBIG_private_unit_tests_data/stable_projects/registration/Wu2017_RegistrationFusion/data/` folder. The unit test is successful if the screen prints `The two volumes are identical`.

This should take about 40min to run.
